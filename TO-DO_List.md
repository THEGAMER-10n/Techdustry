# TO-DO's

##### This is my TO-DO list and my Ideas for the mod. I will never delete old ideas. Instead, I will add the new ones at the bottom(bruh, why.)

# Plans:
## 2 more "Snipe" turret-tree upgrades.
* 3x3 turret:
    * Name: Lightning
    * Damage: Not sure yet
    * Range: Calculating
* 4x4 turret:
    * Everything about this guy is not yet sure.

## 2 ground-air missile turrets.
* Shrapnel:
    * First in the "Destroyer" turrets tree.
    * Damage: 550
    * Range: Not sure
* Point: 
    * First in the "Titan" turrets tree.
    * Basically a bridge between the mod's mid-game to end-game turrets.
    * Not sure about the rest.
    
* Each of them has their own upgrades.
