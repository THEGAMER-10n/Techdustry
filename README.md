### __The content coming after I finish the first sprites.__

#### Powdered Titanium

    * Creates freezing effect.
    * Can be used to create cyrofluid
* Of course, there should be a 2x2 factory for pulverizing titanium.

* Produces powdered titanium.

#### Ground-Air Turrets(Missile)
* 2 variants each with different upgrades

#### 2 more upgrades to the spark-tree turrets
