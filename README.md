# Techdustry
__Current version__: 0.1a-beta

## Total overhaul of the mod.

### Balanced techium and turned it to an Mid-/End-Game material instead.

The old techium is quite unbalanced because of the weapons and techs it can make.

By turning it into a sort of overlap between mid-game(Between the silicon and titanium tech) and end-game(Between thorium and surge-alloy tech) technologies, I think thet will balance it out.

### Totally changing the turrets, contents and sprites.

The old "sniper" turrets is very unbalanced when they reach the 3rd and 4th upgrades.

The sprites are awful.

Many contents are very unbalanced.

### Changed the TO-DO with a dev journal.

Yes, This is more better than a one-page TO-DO list

All contents in this is in a separate folder.
