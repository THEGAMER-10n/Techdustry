DM me on discord if you want to do it.

### The content coming after I finish the first sprites.

#### Powdered Titanium
* Used as ammunition.
    * Creates freezing effect.
    * Can be used to create cyrofluif
* Of course, there should be a 2x2 factory for pulverizing titanium.

#### Titanium Pulveriser
* Produces powdered titanium.

#### Ground-Air Turrets(Missile)
* 2 variants each with different upgrades

#### 2 more upgrades to the spark-tree turrets
* A 3x3 3/4 the range of a foreshadow.
    * This time, It can use techium as ammo.
    * 1.5x the damage at the cost of it needing power.

* 4x4 turret. 5/4 (1 and 1/4) the range of a foreshadow.
    * Needs large amounts of power
    * Needs Powdered Titanium as a coolant.
    * Same damage as the foreshadow.
    * Very expensive.

###### Probably more will come to my head later on after the beta.
